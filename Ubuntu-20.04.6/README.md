# Preliminaries
Install a fresh "Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS" and copy this folder to a location of your choice.

# Installation and execution
Run "run.sh" as the superuser ( sudo ./build-docker.sh ).
Wait until the script finishes. This will require quite some time as Paraview and TTK must be built (55 minutes on an i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz laptop).
The "/home" folder now contains a "noisyTerrainMSS.jpg" reproducing Figure 6a.
